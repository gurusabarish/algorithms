## Bubble sort:

* Worst and average case time complexcity: O(n^2) Worst case arrive when the list or array is reverse sorted.
* Best time complexcity: O(n) Best case arrive when the list or array is already sorted.
* Auxiliary space: O(1)
* Stable: Yes
* Method: Exchange
* Class: comparision sort
## Selection sort:
* Worst,average and Best time complexcity: O(n^2)
* Auxiliary space: O(1)
